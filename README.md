# Discipline
A tool to extract the active Discord Token from Discord and Discord Canary.

Discipline works by scanning local Discord databases for a string that matches the default Discord Token format.
Inspired by [this comment](https://0x00sec.org/t/using-uri-to-pop-shells-via-the-discord-client/11673/2) on a post about Discord security.
